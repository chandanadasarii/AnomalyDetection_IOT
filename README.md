# AnomalyDetection_IOT

This project is to identify the Anamolies in the Sensor generated data.
The data used in this project is generated by the environmental sensors such as Temparature, Humidity , Pressure, Noise, Wifi Senson and etc.

By Analyzing all the Sensors and Its correlation with each other and its True Distribution. Identifying the Anomalies in the Real time.
